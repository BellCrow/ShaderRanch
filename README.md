# ShaderRanch
A collection of fragment shaders that employ different themes and techniques.

# What am I looking at here ?
These are fragment shaders. They are small programs, that are send to your GPU and it will take these
in order to create a picture. 

In order to create a picture the shader program, is executed independently for every single pixel, that is visible. The only information the shader gets is a 2-Dimensional vector, that describes where on the screen the pixel is that is currently supposed to be calculated.

A good resource to get into learning how to write these kind of shaders is [Book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

Im developing these shaders in Visual Studio Code using [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevensona.shader-toy) plugin. These shaders can also be used on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) but you would have to fix up some constants like iTime which would be called u_time on shadertoy.

Feel free to use these shaders partly or in full for what ever purpose you choose, but I would appreciate it if you could leave a link to this repository. See the license for specific information and the usual legal stuff.
